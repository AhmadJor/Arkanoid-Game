## What I Learned
Working on this project was a great learning experience for me. I had the opportunity to put into practice what I learned about Java, OOP principles, design patterns, and GUI development. Some of the key things I learned include:

- Java programming concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- OOP principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance.
- Design patterns such as the Singleton pattern and the Observer pattern.
- GUI development using JavaFX and the Scene Builder tool.
## Conclusion
I hope you enjoy playing this Arkanoid game as much as I enjoyed developing it. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me. Thank you for checking out my project!
